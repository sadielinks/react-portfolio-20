//     My name is Sadie Sial and I am currently a Clinical Research
//     Coordinator at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of
//     Medicine. I am currently enrolled in NU's Full-Stack Bootcamp
//     program through my department. I hope to obtain necessary
//     development skills required for interesting new projects on the
//     horizon! Although these projects would be based on back-end development, I am proud to now be a full-stack
//     developer.
